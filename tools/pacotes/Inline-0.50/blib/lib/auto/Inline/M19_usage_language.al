Error. You have specified '$language' as an Inline programming language.

I currently only know about the following languages:
    ${ defined $Inline::languages ?
       \ join(', ', sort keys %$Inline::languages) : \ ''
     }

If you have installed a support module for this language, try deleting the
config-${Config::Config{'archname'}}-$] file from the following Inline DIRECTORY, and run again:

    $directory

(And if that works, please file a bug report.)

END
