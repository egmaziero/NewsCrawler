# 0.44 To Do List

done:
  - Mark Fowler fix: >
      This fix involves calling validate() even when build() is not
      called. It affects only the interpreted ILSMs
  - Fix grammars to handle 'const' etc.
  - Allow other module languages besides C. (Esp C++)
  - Inline::MakeMaker replacement: >
      This rewrite is completed for the core Inline. Should be easy to
      bring over.
  - Add a patch from Rafael Garcia-Suarez that uses $^X when
    $Config{perlpath} is wrong. (0.44/patch4)
  - Test the recursive build suite
  - Change the way that error output is displayed.
  - use File::Spec: >
      It is top priority to turn all file path operations under the
      control of File::Spec, so that Inline can be ported to other
      platforms.
  - Apply Mitchell's File::Spec patch
  - Copy Regex::Common regexps to charity.pm
  - Mitchell Charity patch: >
      Mitchell wrote a drop in replacement for the Parse::RecDescent
      one. This needs to be moved to Inline::C::ParserRegexp
  - Add USING parameter to specify a list of classes for Inline to inherit
    replacement functionality to.
  - Add a WARNINGS option (default to 1)
  - Add more build warnings for NOISY
  - Add BUILD_TIMERS (TIMERS)
  - Email Mark Fowler with typemap idea
  - Change the precision of Time::HiRes messages.
  - INFO option causes parse to fail
  - Documentation review

High priority:
  * Fix installation problem with lesser ILSMs reported by Mitchell.
  - Patch perlcall example in Cookbook to be safer. This requires calls
    outside the Inline Stack Macros.
  - Allow *.h typemap *.c from cwd() to work without full pathnames
    - Support COPY_TO_BUILD => [ '*.c', 'typemap', 'foo.h' ]
  - Warn when non-static functions don't bind.
  - Warn if no functions were bound at all
  - int foo(...) hack
  - add 'int foo(void) {'
  - Support the types that Nicholas reported
  - Allow spaces in path names

Medium Priority:
  - Add an Inline typemap to replace the Ext::Utils one
  - Redo the test suite to be faster. Eliminate duplicate tests.
  - Apply user patches
  - Regression tests: >
      These can be run outside of make test. They can use YAML, etc.
  - Investigate not needing the .inl files for dummy targets in
    Inline::MakeMaker
  - Try to support lib/ in Inline::MakeMaker
  - Eliminate Inline::denter with a simple regexp parser and heredoc emitter

Lower Priority:
  - Relative paths need to be resolved in relation to the cwd rather
    than the Inline build directory.
  - Inline/Inline::Devel/Inline::Build split:
      This needs to happen soon. Maybe in 0.45.
  - Remove the 'config' complexity
  - Make #line numbers resolve to Perl code.

Bugs:

Next Release:
  - Rewrite the Inline API macros:
    - Possible cross-compatibility with Python/Ruby
  - Support Attribute::Handlers
  - Inline::TT/WebChat have install probs:
      The following fixes it:
        #local $ENV{PERL5LIB} if defined $ENV{PERL5LIB};
