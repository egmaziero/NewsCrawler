# Revision history for Perl extension Inline.

--- version 0.50
date Tues 7 Feb 2012
      Version 0.50 released to CPAN
      Inline.pm - Bump version number to 0.50

--- version 0.49_02
date Fri 3 Feb 2012
      Version 0.49_02 released to CPAN
      Inline.pm - Bring version numbering into line with recommendations made in
                  http://perldoc.perl.org/perlmodstyle.html#Version-numbering

--- version 0.49_01
date Thurs 2 Feb 2012
      Version 0.49_01 released to CPAN.
	Inline.pm - Rename create_config_file()'s private @INC to @_inc.
                  (This is just to avoid any confusion that we might be
                  messing with @INC.)
                - In creating @_inc, we now additionally grep for the location
                  of Parse::RecDescent - in case it's in a different PERL5LIB
                  location to Inline (as generally happens with cpan smokers -
                  but could happen anywhere).
                - Update copyright dates throughout.

--- version 0.49_01
date Mon 23 Jan 2012
      C/t - Make alterations to all of the '.t' files in C/t (except
            for 00init.t). This is in reponse to ticket 73448, which
            raised the possibility that Inline may get built with the
            PERL_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable set.
      Inline.pod - mention the need to make provision for the
                   PERL_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable iff it has
                   been set.

--- version 0.49_01
date Sun 25 Dec 2011
      As the result of input from David Oswald:
      Inline.pod - Changes relating to "CONFIGURE_REQUIRES" and fix
                   typo reported in ticket 73108.
      Inline-FAQ.pod - Changes relating to "CONFIGURE_REQUIRES"
      Inline.pm - Bump version to 0.49_01
      lib/Inline/MakeMaker.pm - Bump version to 0.49_01

---
version 0.49
date: Thurs 8 Dec 2011
      Version 0.49 released to CPAN
      Inline.pm - small alteration to M19_usage_language error message

---
version 0.48_02
date: Mon 5 Dec 2011
      Version 0.48_02 released to CPAN
      Inline.pm - Have the config file re-created *before* we croak with
                  M19_usage_language(). (Re-creating the config file should
                  alleviate the need to croak, thus allowing the script to
                  complete successfully.) Thanks to Patrick LeBoutillier for
                  the patch, and to David Oswald for pursuing this.

version: 0.45_02
date:    Fri Feb 5 2010
 Changes to Inline.pm, denter.pm, and Inline.pod relating to "fixing" untainting
 (to the extent that untainting of -T inline scripts works as documented).
 Many thanks to Patrick LeBoutillier.
 Also added C/t/08taint.t (which contains -T on the shebang line) as a basic test

  - In C/C.pm, allow for the calling of multiple typemaps (RT ticket 5639), and
    have the "No Inline C functions bound to Perl" warning specify the file for

---
version: 0.44
date:    Mon Oct 28 10:31:51 PST 2002
changes:
  - Doc fixes. Thanks Mitchell.
  - Put all current ILSMs in doc and Makefile.PL

---
version: 0.44
date:    Sun Oct 27 23:34:50 PST 2002
changes:
  - Applied some patches from Patrick LeBoutillier, including one to make
    things work out of the box on Win95 and friends. Rob helped too.
  - Added a warning to help debug why certain ILSMs might be failing.

---
version: 0.44
date:    Fri Oct 25 10:12:16 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Changes to Inline-FAQ

---
version: 0.44
date:    Thu Oct 24 16:17:27 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Fixed ParseRecDescent to handle 'unsigned foo()' and 'long foo()'
  - Updated README
  - Fixed %INC problem

---
version: 0.44
date:    Wed Oct 23 10:27:41 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Used File::Spec::Unix for %INC keys (which are always in Unix form)

---
version: 0.44
date:    Mon Oct 21 16:49:54 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Applied Mitchell's patch for Inline::C::ParseRegExp

---
version: 0.44
date:    Mon Oct 21 00:17:22 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Updated pod docs

---
version: 0.44
date:    Thu Oct 17 20:00:46 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Shortened BUILD_TIMER precision, per Leon Brocard's suggestion.
  - Applied Mitchell Charity's patch to fix Piers Harding's CPP problem.
  - Fixed bug with USING keyword

---
version: 0.44
date:    Fri Oct 11 18:09:03 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Added the USING keyword. This allows you to specify a list of modules
    which can override certain parts of the Inline process.
  - Added Inline::C::ParseRecDescent and Inline::C::ParseRegExp to
    provide two (hopefully) functionally identical C parsers. You use
    one of these by saying 'use Inline C => DATA => USING => "ParseRegExp"'.
    Big thanks to Mitchell Charity for ParseRegExp. It's over two orders
    of magnitude faster than ParseRecDescent.
  - Added the more diagnostics to BUILD_NOISY.
  - Added BUILD_TIMERS for benchmarking the Inline build process.

---
version: 0.44
date:    Wed Oct  9 19:03:34 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Applied a (BIG) patch to the Inline distribution to use File::Spec
    to manipulate all file paths. Thanks Mitchell Charity!

---
version: 0.44
date:    Tue Oct  8 11:47:39 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Fixed a bug in OS X. Inline::C was being required even if the object was
    cached. That's because Inline.pm wasn't checking for .bundle.

---
version: 0.44
date:    Tue Oct  8 10:33:13 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Added an option to Inline::C called BUILD_NOISY. Setting this to
    true will cause the build process to dump output to the screen
    instead of to a file. You can set it with 'BUILD_NOISY => 1,' or
    'ENABLE => "BUILD_NOISY"'.
  - Honor the PERL_INLINE_BUILD_NOISY environment variable, to do the
    same as above. Environment variable has higher precedence.
  - Print the contents of 'out.make' to the screen on failure. This will
    happen when BUILD_NOISY is off. When its on, you'll see the messages
    in real time, but they won't go to 'out.make'.
  - Provide the NOISY shortcut so you can say
    'perl -MInline=force,noisy foo.pl'.
  - Inline::MakeMaker uses the NOISY shortcut for its build command.
    This way module builds are noisy like they should be.

---
version: 0.44
date:    Thu Oct  3 17:40:27 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Integrated the new improved Inline::MakeMaker
  - WriteInlineMakefile is deprecated for WriteMakefile

---
version: 0.44
date:    Thu Oct  3 17:09:20 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Added a patch by Rafael Garcia-Suarez to use $^X when
    $Config::Config{perlpath} is wrong. (It happens)

---
version: 0.44
date:    Thu Oct  3 16:51:39 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Refactored the Parse::RecDescent grammar
  - Moved grammar module to Inline::C::recdescent
  - Support 'const' in types. Requested by Nicholas Clark
  - Other modifiers seemed to be busted. Like 'unsigned'. Got them working.
  - Started integrating Mitchell Charity's parser. Don't know how to
    turn it on yet. It's currently in Inline::C::charity

---
version: 0.44
date:    Thu Oct  3 16:20:56 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Allow C++ based modules to be installed as well as C ones. Requested
    by Piers Harding.

---
version: 0.44
date:    Wed Oct  2 21:04:13 PDT 2002
changes:
  - Call validate() for interpreted ILSMs even on load(). This patch is
    dedicated to the very patient Mark Fowler who waited almost a year
    for it. I hope that never happens again.

0.43  Sat Jul 21 14:58:46 PDT 2001
        - Removed *old* deprecated functionality.

0.43  Sat Jul 21 14:53:33 PDT 2001
        - Inline now works with *all* Perl release versions 5.005 and above.

0.43  Thu Jul 19 17:29:17 PDT 2001
        - I was comparing a version number to a md5 hash. Oops. Thanks Marcel.

0.43  Thu Jul 19 17:29:17 PDT 2001
        - Changed M51 error message which was causing confusion. It would
          often come up in places I didn't anticipate.

0.43  Thu Jul 19 17:29:17 PDT 2001
        - Use $Config{dlext} instead of $Config{so}. Thanks Marcel.

0.42  Sun Jun 10 18:21:06 PDT 2001
        - Re-fixed config generator path bug prevents ILSMs like I::Python
          and I::Tcl from installing. (NEILW)

0.41  Tue Jun  5 00:23:46 PDT 2001
        - Don't install .inline or .inl files with Inline::MakeMaker.
          Require object name to be same as package name for installation.
          Put hack in INIT block to fix Sarathy's patch ;)

0.41  Sat Jun  2 19:53:58 PDT 2001
        - Fixed config generator path bug that would prevent other ILSMs
          from installing. Thanks Patrick.

0.41  Sat Jun  2 19:53:58 PDT 2001
        - Applied patch to (hopefully) handle CRLF variations properly.
          Thanks Binkley

0.40  Sun May 27 18:59:59 PDT 2001
        - Bugfix. NAME not set right without AUTONAME.

0.40  Sat May 26 13:41:18 PDT 2001
        - TRIAL8 of Inline-0.40
          Added option to distribute binary PPM modules with or without source.
          Got UNTAINT to work again.

0.40  Wed May 23 18:19:16 PDT 2001
        - TRIAL7 of Inline-0.40
          Fixed path bus for MacOS. Thanks Marcel.
          'with' works again (with Event)
          Inline::MakeMaker adds WriteMakefile dependency for Inline 0.40

0.40  Wed May 23 01:14:23 PDT 2001
        - TRIAL6 of Inline-0.40
          Made Denter YAML compliant
          Croak on usage of SITE_INSTALL
          Update Inline.pod for 0.40 features
          Detect and croak on old config files

0.40  Mon May 21 18:06:30 PDT 2001
        - TRIAL5 of Inline-0.40
          Added alpha support for Inline::Files
          Made all internal path names canonical

0.40  Sun May 13 23:38:26 PDT 2001
        - Finished TRIAL1 version of Inline-0.40
          Short object names
          Safer config generation
          AUTONAME support
          Reinstituted AutoLoading
          Put all messages into subroutines inside Inline.pm

0.40  Wed May  9 11:14:47 PDT 2001
        - Completely reorganized the Inline internal object into major groups:
          API - Contract space for the ILSMs. Guaranteed backwards compatible
                after Inline 1.00.
          ILSM - Private space for ILSMs
          INLINE - Private Inline space. Subject to constant change.
          CONFIG - Config options. Not for use by ILSMs
          MATCH - Matching criteria for the object.
          STRUCT - Reserved for Inline::Struct

0.40  Wed May  9 11:14:47 PDT 2001
        - Added command proxy logic for Inline::MakeMaker utilities:
          INSTALL, MAKEDIST, MAKEPPD

0.40  Wed May  9 11:14:47 PDT 2001
        - Got _INSTALL_ option working with Inline::MakeMaker

0.40  Sun Apr 29 13:58:40 PDT 2001
        - Replaced Inline's use of Data::Dumper with Inline::Denter.
          This is a stripped down version of Data::Denter. This change
          makes Inline more secure because it doesn't need to eval()
          untrusted code. Also removes the dependency on Safe.pm which has
          known security flaws. Yay!

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
        - 'require FindBin' instead of 'use FindBin' for mod_perl.

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
        - Fixed Win32 bug. Drive letter 'c:' can be lower case.

        - Changed 'make install' to 'make pure_install'

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
        - Fixed bug of assuminh ':' for PATH separator. (Windows bug)

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
        - Rearranged test harness. Removed dependency on C for tests.
          Invented Inline::Foo for testing.

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
        - Added ENABLE and DISABLE config modifiers.

0.33  Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
        - Changed the way ILSMs are detected.

0.32  Mon Feb 26 07:44:34 PST 2001
        - Add DIRECTORY path to applicable warnings and error msgs

0.32  Mon Feb 26 07:42:32 PST 2001
        - Warn if UNTAINT && SAFEMODE && ! DIRECTORY (croak if root)

0.32  Mon Feb 26 01:07:15 PST 2001
        - Added GLOBAL_LOAD option with GLOBAL shortcut.

0.32  Mon Feb 26 01:00:00 PST 2001
        - Added SAFEMODE option.
        - Safe->reval(DIRECTORY/config) if SAFE.
        - Blindly untaint all %ENV variables for UNTAINT.

0.32  Fri Feb 23 03:20:19 PST 2001
        - Fixed MSWin32 bug of getting full path parts in dll name.

0.32  Thu Feb 22 02:35:04 PST 2001
        - Fixed the "cut & paste" bug. (DOS line endings in Unix.)

0.32  Thu Feb 22 02:10:07 PST 2001
        - Fixed detection of using Inline::Config.

0.32  Wed Feb 21 23:40:33 PST 2001
        - Added UNTAINT option, which lets you use Inline with Perl's -T flag.

0.31  Fri Jan 19 00:13:31 PST 2001
        - Changed doc instances of 'C<Inline>' to 'Inline'.

0.31  Sat Jan 13 11:49:14 PST 2001
        - Reorganized the internal structure of the Inline DIRECTORY
        - Shortened install path to .Inline/lib/auto/...
        - Lengthened the build path to .Inline/build/...

0.31  Sat Jan 13 11:18:22 PST 2001
        - Changed BLIB option to DIRECTORY
        - Changed default DIRECTORY from blib_I to _Inline or .Inline

0.30  Fri Dec  8 02:00:17 PST 2000
        - Major reworking of Inline.pm
        Sweeping changes to:
        - Configuaration
        - Syntax
        - Language integration
        Too much to list here. See ToDo

0.26  Thu Sep 14 20:51:11 PDT 2000
        - localize $/ and $\ to shield them from things like 'perl -l'.
        Thanks Michael Schwern.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 10:07:33 PDT 2000
        - Use MD5 on unmodified code only. User must force recompile if
        auto_headers change. This would have caused existing installs to break.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 10:04:14 PDT 2000
        - Don't determine build path unless really needed, since a blib_I might
        be created. This might be annoying for someone who is only *using* an
        Inline extension module.

0.25  Fri Sep  1 08:35:53 PDT 2000
        - Mangle $VERSION into object name for modules

0.25  Thu Aug 31 22:46:25 PDT 2000
        - Support Inline->import(C=><DATA>); syntax

0.25  Sun Aug 20 20:52:24 PDT 2000
        - Return an empty list when the C function is of type void and doesn't
        use any stack manipulating macros. (ie dXSARGS) It used to return
        whatever was passed in on the stack. :-(

0.25  Fri Aug 18 18:45:24 PDT 2000
        - Force rebuild when SITE_INSTALL option is set.

0.25  Fri Aug 18 18:15:34 PDT 2000
        - Figured out what was actually causing the 0.23 AutoLoader bug.
        Can't autoload from "./blib" (relative path) when chdir() has been
        used. Fixed properly now. Can AutoLoad fix_make() again. :-)

0.24  Fri Aug 18 03:03:06 PDT 2000
        - Fixed Autoload bug found during "make test" of Inline installation.

0.23  Wed Aug 16 18:10:07 PDT 2000
        - Added support for MSWin32 operating systems which use the Microsoft
