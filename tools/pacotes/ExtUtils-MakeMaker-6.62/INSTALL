For all users on most Unix systems:

    sudo make install

For all users on most Windows systems:

    perl Makefile.PL
    dmake
    dmake test
    dmake install

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~
    make
    make test

Run "perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker" while in this source directory for
more instructions.

We recommend against installing into a path with a space or other
special character in the name (such as C:\Program Files on Windows).


SPECIAL NOTE TO PACKAGERS

ExtUtils::MakeMaker is designed to have no dependencies which don't
ship with Perl (except make).  In reality, it does, so it ships with
copies of these modules.  They only install if newer versions of those
modules aren't already installed.

That these dependencies are undeclared in order to avoid confusing the
normal CPAN source installation process.  A naive packaging of
MakeMaker will incorrectly include these other modules in the
ExtUtils-MakeMaker package.

ExtUtils-Install, ExtUtils-Manifest and ExtUtils-Command should be
shipped as *separate packages* from ExtUtils-MakeMaker.  They have
their own releases and schedules.

Packagers should:

1. Delete the inc/ directory which contains those dependencies before
   packaging ExtUtils-MakeMaker.  This will prevent them from becoming
   part of the MakeMaker package.

2. Insert runtime dependencies upon ExtUtils-Install,
   ExtUtils-Manifest and ExtUtils-Command.  Check
   inc/ExtUtils/Install.pm, inc/ExtUtils/Manifest.pm and
   inc/ExtUtils/Command.pm for their current versions.
